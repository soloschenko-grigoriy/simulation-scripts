# Simulation Scripts
This repo contains almost the entire source of the Simulation project. To protect all the hard work amazing creators put into crafting the assets I have used in this project, this code being open-sourced DOES NOT include any paid assets (texture, models, SFX, etc).

As a result, the project may not be able to be compiled and if it does, it looks not like the actual game. However, I still hope you will find my scripts helpful in building your game
